## Yet Another Simple Event Calendar

https://github.com/improper/mediawiki-extensions-yasec

Outputs a tabular calendar filled with events automatically generated
from page titles in a certain namespace. Based on the [intersection extension][1]
and the [FullCalendar jQuery plugin][2].

Demo: [FoodHackingBase Events][3]

### Usage

EventCalendar expects page titles in the following format in a certain
namespace:

    yyyy/mm/dd Event Title

for example

    Event:2014/02/14_Synchronous_Hackathon

Multi-day events can be created by setting up consecutive dates with the
same title, like

    Event:2014/02/14_Synchronous_Hackathon
    Event:2014/02/15_Synchronous_Hackathon
    Event:2014/02/16_Synchronous_Hackathon

where the second and following pages will usually redirect to the first.

Typical invocation on a page:

    <EventCalendar>
    namespace = Event
    aspectratio = 1.35
    lang = en
    </EventCalendar>

`aspectratio` is optional and defaults to 1.6. CSS `max-width` is set to
800px and can be overridden in `MediaWiki:Common.css`.

`lang` is optional and defaults to en. Other languages code options can
be found in /resources/fullcalendar/fullcalendar/lang directory

### Requirements

* MediaWiki 1.22 (will probably work with other versions, comments
  appreciated)
* MySQL (see [#1][4])

### Installation

1. Deploy the files to `extensions/yasec`.
2. Edit your `LocalSettings.php`:
    * Load the extension:

      ```php
      include("$IP/extensions/yasec/EventCalendar.php");
      ```

    * Setup your namespace:

      ```php
      $wgExtraNamespaces = array(
          100 => "Event",
          101 => "Event_talk",
      );
      $wgNamespacesToBeSearchedDefault = array(
          NS_MAIN => true,
          100     => true,
      );
      ```

    * For testing you might want to disable the cache:

      ```php
      # How long to cache pages using EventCalendar in seconds. Default to 1 day.
      # Set to false to use the normal amount of page caching (most efficient),
      # set to 0 to disable cache altogether (inefficient, but results will never
      # be outdated)
      $wgECMaxCacheTime = 60*60*24;   // How long to cache pages in seconds
      ```
